Enter the Dividend=50
Enter the Divisor=10
The Quotient obtained is= 5
The Remainder obtained is= 0
The List of the output obtained is= [5, 0]
The Divmod Function is not Callable
All the values are not nonzero
After adding 4,5 and 6 to our result gives [5, 0, 4, 5, 6]
Converting the List to Set Datatype
The Set1 is= {0, 4, 5, 6}
The Required Set is= {4, 5, 6}
To make the Set immutable, we have used frozenset function
The maximum value in the Set is= 6
The Hashed value of the maximum value obtained from the Set is= 6
The Inbuilt Python Hashing function generally returns the same integer value which is given as input

On Doing emp3.Info(), we will receive an error message
The error states that  emp3.Info()  
 NameError: name 'emp3' is not defined
We receive an Error as we are trying to use a class function on the object emp3
But by using del,that object has been deleted
As it does not exists,but still we are trying to use it so we get an error
